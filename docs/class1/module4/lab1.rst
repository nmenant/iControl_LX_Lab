Lab 4.1 - Creating the HelloWorld iControl LX Extension
-------------------------------------------------------

iControl LX extensions are distributed as RPMs (RedHat Package Management
system) when you want to leverage something existing. However when you start
from scratch, you'll need to create your extension and then build a RPM that
you can distribute accordingly.

Task 1 - Create our iControl LX Extension on iWorkflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

iControl LX extensions can be installed on either the BIG-IP or iWorkflow
platform. For this lab, we will use iWorkflow.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. Connect to your iWorkflow platform  via ssh/Putty(``10.1.10.20``)


#. iControl LX extensions reside in ``/var/config/rest/iapps/``. This is where
   you need to create your iControl LX extension. Usually you will create:

   * A folder that is the name of your app: ``HelloWorld``

   .. NOTE:: This folder name is important since this is what will be used as
      the RPM name when we will create our package later.

   * inside the app folder, another folder called ``nodejs`` that will contain
     your extension

#. Let's create our directory tree. On your iWorkflow platform, execute:

   ``mkdir -p /var/config/rest/iapps/HelloWorld/nodejs/``

#. Now that we have our directory, we need to create our extension. Use your
   preferred editor and create a file named ``hello_world.js`` in
   ``/var/config/rest/iapps/HelloWorld/nodejs/``:

   ``nano /var/config/rest/iapps/HelloWorld/nodejs/hello_world.js``

   .. NOTE:: If you have not used nano before:  After you paste in the contents below, you will type ``CTRL-X`` to exit the editor.  You will then be prompted to save the file, type ``Y`` to confirm.

#. Copy/Paste the following content into your file:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      /**
      * A simple iControl LX extension that handles only HTTP GET
      */
      function HelloWorld() {}

      HelloWorld.prototype.WORKER_URI_PATH = "ilxe_lab/hello_world";
      HelloWorld.prototype.isPublic = true;

      /**
      * handle onGet HTTP request
      */
      HelloWorld.prototype.onGet = function(restOperation) {
        restOperation.setBody(JSON.stringify( { value: "Hello World!" } ));
        this.completeRestOperation(restOperation);
      };

      /**
      * handle /example HTTP request
      */
      HelloWorld.prototype.getExampleState = function () {
        return {
          "value": "your_string"
        };
      };

      module.exports = HelloWorld;

#. Save the changes (``ESC ESC :wq`` if you use ``vi`)

#. Once our extension is created, we need to load it into ``restnoded``. When
   an extension is loaded from a RPM, it is done automatically. However here,
   we will need to do it ourselves

   Use the following command on iWorkflow to make ``restnoded`` aware of our
   extension:

   ``restcurl shared/nodejs/loader-path-config -d '{"workerPath": "/var/config/rest/iapps/HelloWorld"}'``

   .. NOTE:: ``restcurl`` is a utility that allows you to communicate with iControl REST via the CLI.

   The output should look like this:

   .. code::

     $ restcurl shared/nodejs/loader-path-config -d '{"workerPath": "/var/config/rest/iapps/HelloWorld"}'
     {
       "id": "ad130c79-59a0-49c7-a7e7-ff39efe956b5",
       "workerPath": "/var/config/rest/iapps/HelloWorld",
       "generation": 1,
       "lastUpdateMicros": 1508242306312732,
       "kind": "shared:nodejs:loader-path-config:loaderpathstate",
       "selfLink": "https://localhost/mgmt/shared/nodejs/loader-path-config/ad130c79-59a0-49c7-a7e7-ff39efe956b5"
     }

#. The logfile ``/var/log/restnoded/restnoded.0.log`` will give you the ability to track
   whether your extension is loaded as expected. Run the following command to
   ensure everything went smoothly:

   ``grep HelloWorld /var/log/restnoded/restnoded.log``

   The output should look like this:

   .. code::

Task 2 - Check our iControl LX Extension is Working
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. In your web browser, navigate to ``https://10.1.10.20/mgmt/ilxe_lab/hello_world``

#. You should see something like this:

   .. image:: ../../_static/class1/module4/lab1-image001.png
      :align: center
      :scale: 50%

#. You could also use ``curl`` in CLI (from iWorkflow CLI for example):

   ``curl -k -u admin:admin https://10.1.10.20/mgmt/ilxe_lab/hello_world``

   Or a REST client like POSTMAN.

#. Another test is to connect to our ``/example`` uri. Navigate with your
   browser to ``https://10.1.10.20/mgmt/ilxe_lab/hello_world/example``

#. You should see something like this:

   .. image:: ../../_static/class1/module4/lab1-image002.png
      :align: center
      :scale: 50%

#. You can also use curl in CLI:

   ``curl -k -u admin:admin https://10.1.10.20/mgmt/ilxe_lab/hello_world/example``

.. NOTE:: You may NOT want to use admin priviledges to leverage an extension.
   In many situation the extension may be needed only by a specific user and
   then you should be able to enforce some RBAC policies here. BIG-IP 13.1 will
   provide this capability (`BIG-IP RBAC API`_).
   With iWorkflow, you can already setup RBAC for the API. For a specific user,
   you can specify which
   URIs they have access to and also which HTTP Methods he can use against those
   URIs.
