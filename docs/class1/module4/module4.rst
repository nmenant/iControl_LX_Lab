Module 4 - Installing the HelloWorld extension
===============================================

In module 4, we are going to create our first iControl LX extension, the
``HelloWorld`` extension. It doesn't do much but it's simple and perfect for
illustrating the package management system.

.. NOTE::

  In this lab, we will make you do edits on the platform itself.
  You'll connect on iWorkflow and do everything on it. It's not necessarily
  a best practice. You could also have a local version on your JumpHost and use
  ``Notepad++`` (already installed on your JumpHost, feel free to install
  something else) to do the work. Once your file is updated accordingly,
  you may use WinSCP to push the new version.
