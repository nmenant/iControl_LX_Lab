Lab 3.2 - Beyond "GET"
----------------------

Task 1 - Understand the 'other' HTTP Verbs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The iControl LX Framework also provides access to the following HTTP verbs:
``POST``, ``PUT``, ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE``. 

In this lab; you will learn which HTTP verb to use.

POST is for Creating Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous exercise we created a new user in the
``/mgmt/shared/authz/users/`` collection. This was done by sending a ``POST`` to
``https://<ip_address>/mgmt/shared/authz/users/`` and resulted in a new REST
resource under the ``users`` collection.

The ``onPost()`` HTTP Method processor must be implemented to handle an HTTP ``POST`` in your iControl LX Extension.

PUT is for Replacing a Resources Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Think of ``PUT`` as a special type of ``POST`` for existing REST resources.
Let's say we have the following REST resource:

``/mgmt/shared/authz/users/new_user``

with the properties:

.. code:: json

   {
       "name": "new_user",
       "role": "manager",
       "password":"xyz1234"
   }

If we were to perform the following ``PUT``, the ``role`` would no longer exist:

.. code ::

   PUT /mgmt/shared/authz/users/new_user
   {
       "name": "new_user"
       "password":"xyz1234"
   }


Performing a ``PUT`` on a REST resource is like performing a 'select-all' and
then 'replace'.

For your iControl LX extension to handle an HTTP ``PUT``, you must implement the
``onPut()`` HTTP Method processor.

PATCH is for Editing Parts of a REST Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``PATCH`` is for situations where you may want to change only parts of a REST
resource. For example, let's say I want to change the ``role`` of our
``new_user`` resource:

.. code::

   PATCH /mgmt/shared/authz/users/new_user
   {
       "role": "manager"
   }

The other properties, in this case ``name`` and ``password``, would remain
untouched.

For your iControl LX extension to handle an HTTP ``PATCH``, you must implement
the ``onPatch()`` HTTP Method processor.

DELETE a REST Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the event that you want to delete a resource you would implement the
``onDelete()`` HTTP Method processor.

.. code::

   DELETE /mgmt/shared/authz/users/new_user

.. NOTE:: You can delete a resource but not a collection. For example, you can
   ``DELETE`` ``/mgmt/shared/authz/users/new_user``, but not
   ``/mgmt/shared/authz/users``.
