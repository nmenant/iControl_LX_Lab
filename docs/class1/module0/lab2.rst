Lab 0.2 - Access Your lab
-------------------------

Task 1 - Launch your RDP session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once your deployment is up and running, you should try to access the JumpHost
via RDP.

Perform the following steps to complete this task:

#. In the UDF interface, go to :guilabel:`Deployments`

#. Find the deployment named ``Intro to iControl LX extension`` and click
   :guilabel:`Details`

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Components` tab and find the component named
   ``JumpHost`` in the :guilabel:`Systems` column

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Access` button, then select :guilabel:`RDP`. An
   RDP file will be downloaded automatically that allows you to launch the RDP
   session

   .. WARNING:: For MAC users, it is recommended to use Microsoft Remote
      Desktop. You may not be able to access your jumpbox otherwise. It is
      available in the Mac App Store as a free download.

#. Open the RDP connection to the jumphost

#. Login with the following credentials:

   - Username: ``administrator``
   - Password: ``cXzTEv8E5``

.. NOTE::

   To prevent having to switch between windows or screens this lab guide is
   setup as the homepage of the Chrome browser on the jumphost.
