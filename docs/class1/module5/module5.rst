Module 5 - My First iControl LX Extension
=========================================

When you build a declarative interface, your interface should NOT ask for F5
domain specific knowledge. The consumer of your service catalog should not have
to know what is a F5 Virtual Server, an iRule, a L7 policy, etc... it should be
as abstracted as possible and only focus on information the the consumer is
aware of.

Usually if an application engineer wants to deploy an ADC configuration, here
are the information he can provide:

* Service name
* Service template to use
* Service port
* Servers IP Address
* Servers port
* Servers status
* maybe some application specific attributes

If such an application was to be deployed via a REST API interface, the POST
request (to deploy the service) could look like this:

.. code::

   POST /.../my-app-interface
   {
       "name": "{{my-app-name}}",
       "template" : "f5-http-lb",
       "app-data": [
                   {
                       "name": "pool__port",
                       "value": "{{service-port}}"
                   }
       ],
       "servers-data": [{
           "name": "pool__Members",
           "columns": [
               "IPAddress",
               "State"
           ],
           "rows": [
               [
                   "{{server1-addr}}",
                   "enabled"
               ], [
                   "{{server2-addr}}",
                   "enabled"
               ]
           ]
       }]
   }

Here you may also see that this payload does not use any iWF paramters. It's a
custom build payload that is easier for an application engineer to understand.
He doesn't want to have a deep understanding of F5 solution to deploy services.
It's not his area of expertise.

An example of an attribute that a consumer shouldn't have to provide is our
Virtual Server IP. The consumer doesn't own this segment of the network and
cannot know which IP to specify.  We see more and more requests where they
expect the ADC solution to be able to retrieve this information on its own.

In this lab, we will deploy an iControl LX extension that will communicate with
an IPAM solution to populate automatically this information.

iWorkflow is already setup with 2 service templates:

* HTTP service
* TCP service

Our extension can do the following:

* Receive GET/PUT/POST/DELETE requests
* Retrieve an IP from our IPAM solution (we use an iRule to simulate this. It's
  on the BIG-IP)
* Translate the received payload with the information needed by iWorkflow to
  trigger those templates
